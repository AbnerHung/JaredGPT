# Routes

Through using either native plugins, or a webhook configuration, you can define routes which are used to define triggers for messages. 


`name`: A string for the name of the route. This must be globally unique.
`parameterSyntax`: A string that describes how to exercise your route. 
`description`: A string that describes the purpose of this route
